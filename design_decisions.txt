I have 2 schema design considerations for this performance. Because of advantages in 1st method, I choose to go with this kind of implementation.

1. Refer user id on task:
	I have to add cur user Id to each new task
	Read tasks using taskId as search key
	Advantages:
		1 Write operation required for each new 
		Read performance can be improved by indexing using UserId on Task doc
	

2. Refer task id on user:
	I have to add each new task Id to cur user
	Read tasks using userId as search key
	
	Dis-Advantages
		(2 write operations)I world have to write to both to user and task doc for each new task created
